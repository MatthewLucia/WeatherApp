# Weather Forecast Web Application
This Flask-based web application leverages the weather.gov API to provide users with accurate and up-to-date weather forecasts for any location within the United States. Users can register, log in, and access personalized weather information, including current conditions, historical data, and interactive maps. The project follows best practices for web development, incorporates user authentication, and utilizes Microsoft Bing Maps API for visualizing weather patterns. The codebase is well-organized, documented, and adheres to Flask conventions.
